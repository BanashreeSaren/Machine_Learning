# Linear-Regression
Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear relationship between a dependent variable (also known as the target variable) and one or more independent features (also known as predictor variables). When there’s only one independent feature, it’s called Univariate Linear Regression. If there are multiple features, it’s termed multivariate linear regression
# Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method used for both classification and regression tasks. It is an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree is trained on a different subset of the training data and makes its own independent prediction. 
# Decision Tree
A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It recursively splits the dataset into subsets based on the most significant attribute at each node, creating a tree-like structure of decisions.
